**I will be graduating from Appalachian State University in December 2018. My major is Mathematics with a career concentration in business. I enjoy being outside, playing music and riding motorcycles. I grew up just north of Boone in Ashe County North Carolina and I really like learning and experiencing new things. I'm hoping to use what I've learned with R programming to land a job in an analytics field upon graduation.**
